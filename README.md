The pill lives in your DankBar and shows live usage at a glance. Providers with multiple quota windows (Claude's 5 hour and 7 day, for example) can show any window in the bar — pick it per provider, or let `highest` follow the most-constrained one. Hover the pill to see which window the number came from and when it resets:

![DankBar pill](./docs/assets/bar-pill.png)

## Why AiOverviewControl?

You pay for Claude, Codex, Copilot, OpenRouter — and each one hides its quota
in a different dashboard, CLI, or API. AiOverviewControl collects every
provider **independently and locally**, normalizes the result, and renders one
honest overview without any external aggregation service.

**Honest** is the key word: it reports measured data when a supported source
exists, and clearly labels authentication-only or informational providers when
it does not. No dashboard scraping. No fabricated percentages. Ever.

## Highlights

| | |
| --- | --- |
| 📊 **Unified dashboard** | 37 AI providers and developer tools in one place. |
| 🛰️ **Fleet overview** | Cross-provider rollup in the hero — quota-only average load, hottest provider, how many are near their cap, and the soonest reset. |
| ⏱️ **Official Codex windows** | Rate-limit windows straight from `codex app-server`. |
| 🤖 **Deep Claude analytics** | Quota plus local token, session, model, project, and cost analytics. |
| 🐙 **Copilot quotas** | Premium request, Chat, and Completions snapshots. |
| 🗂️ **Rich provider cards** | Usage windows, reset times, identity, credits, sparklines, trends, and console links. |
| 🛡️ **Failure isolation** | One timeout or invalid credential never hides healthy providers. |
| 🎛️ **Flexible layout** | Compact/comfortable density, status filters, pinned providers, `auto`/`custom`/`top` pill modes, and a per-provider DankBar usage-window choice. |
| 🔔 **Quota notifications** | Branded DMS desktop alerts with global/per-provider thresholds; one toast per quota window, upgraded in place when quota is exhausted. Alerts can follow the window the DankBar shows, every window, or the primary one. |
| 📄 **History export** | Dump the local usage history to CSV or JSONL from Settings, or from `providers/export-usage-history`. |
| 🌍 **5 UI languages** | English, Português (BR), 简体中文, Español, and Deutsch. |
| 🔒 **Privacy first** | Local adapters, no paid endpoints just to test keys, secrets never displayed. |

Per-provider telemetry sections include daily cost charts, today/week/month
totals, token in/out counters, top models, and routed-provider breakdowns —
all read from local, provider-owned data.

## Coverage Model

Provider cards use one of these honest coverage levels:

| Coverage | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Quota** | Returns real rate-limit/spend windows and used percentage (Codex, Copilot, Antigravity, OpenRouter, Z.ai, GLM, Command Code, OpenCode Go, xAI SuperGrok). |
| **Balance** | Returns remaining prepaid balance or credits in real currency (Kimi, DeepSeek, xAI Management API). |
| **Analytics** | Reads consumption counters or provider-owned local data (Cloudflare GraphQL, 9Router, Claude, pi, Hermes). |
| **Authentication** | Verifies credentials via a read-only endpoint without stable quota data (Gemini, Mistral, MiniMax PAYG, Qwen, and more). Some configured-status cards, such as NVIDIA, cannot validate the key because the provider's catalog is public. |
| **Local runtime** | Reports local state rather than account quota (Ollama models, Vertex AI authentication). |
| **Informational** | Links official usage when no read-only API exists (Kiro, Cursor, Warp, and more). |

Notable integrations:

| Provider | Data source |
| --- | --- |
| Codex | Official `codex app-server` account and rate-limit methods. |
| Claude Code | OAuth quota plus local `~/.claude/projects` analytics (or `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/projects` when that env var is set). |
| GitHub Copilot | Authenticated GitHub/Copilot quota snapshot. |
| Antigravity | Gemini and Claude/OpenAI quota families with reset times from Cloud Code Assist; optional per-model diagnostics and automatic multi-account separation. |
| 9Router | Local SQLite or JSON usage data, including routed-model telemetry. |
| pi | Local session JSONL telemetry (`~/.pi/agent/sessions`) — cost, tokens, top models, top projects; no quota API (pi has no rate limits). |
| Hermes | Dual-nature entry: agent-harness telemetry from `~/.hermes/state.db` (sessions, tokens per model/project, sources, API calls) plus provider identity (active billing provider, default model) from `~/.hermes/config.yaml` / `auth.json`. Provider-side billing stays on the [Nous Portal](https://portal.nousresearch.com). |
| OpenRouter | Key limits, spend, balance, and 30-day model activity. |
| Kimi (Moonshot) | Open Platform balance (`GET /v1/users/me/balance`, USD/CNY) — or **Kimi Code** subscription quota (`GET /coding/v1/usages`, weekly + 5h windows) when a `sk-kimi-` / `KIMI_CODING_API_KEY` is set. |
| DeepSeek | Official account balance API. |
| Together | Read-only API-key validation; usage and billing remain in the Together console. |
| Cloudflare | Token verification and optional Workers AI GraphQL analytics. |
| Z.ai, GLM | `GET /api/monitor/usage/quota/limit` — real per-window usage %, reset timestamps, and plan tier. Falls back to `/models` auth-only check. |
| Command Code | Live 5h/weekly/monthly usage via `/alpha/billing/credits`; uses `COMMAND_CODE_API_KEY` or the protected `apiKey` saved by `cmd login` in `~/.commandcode/auth.json`. |
| OpenCode Go | Live 5h/weekly/monthly usage from `/zen/go/v1/usage`; uses `OPENCODE_API_KEY` or the CLI credential in `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/opencode/auth.json`. When the Go plan's balance fallback is enabled, the card says so without claiming a balance amount. |
| xAI (Grok) | SuperGrok weekly/monthly usage from `grok login` (`~/.grok/auth.json`) via the CLI billing API; prepaid API credits from the Management API (`XAI_MANAGEMENT_KEY` + `XAI_TEAM_ID`); `XAI_API_KEY` is auth-only. |
| Qwen, Mistral | Read-only `/models` validation — zero token consumption. |
| MiniMax PAYG (`sk-api-…`) | Read-only `/v1/models` validation — zero token consumption. |
| MiniMax Token Plan (`sk-cp-…`) | Live 5h + weekly windows via `/v1/token_plan/remains`; prefer `MINIMAX_TOKEN_PLAN_KEY`, fall back to `MINIMAX_API_KEY` for older configs. |
| NVIDIA | Configured-key status only; its public model catalog cannot validate the key. |
| Ollama | Installed and running models from `/api/tags` and `/api/ps`. |

The full matrix, credentials, and upstream references are documented in
[Providers](./docs/providers.md) and
[Provider verification](./docs/provider-verification.md).

## Requirements

- DankMaterialShell running on Quickshell.
- `bash`, `jq`, and `curl`.
- Provider-specific CLIs or credentials only for providers you enable. Antigravity needs `secret-tool` for keyring sessions or `sqlite3` for IDE state databases; Hermes and 9Router need `sqlite3` for their local usage databases.
- Quota notifications additionally need `notify-send` and `flock`.

Recommended baseline for the default provider set:

```bash
command -v bash jq curl codex claude gh
codex login
claude auth status
gh auth status
```

## Installation

### DMS Plugin Store (recommended)

```bash
dms plugins install aiOverviewControl
```

Or install **AiOverviewControl** from the plugin store inside DMS settings, or
from the [Dank Plugins directory](https://danklinux.com/plugins). Store installs
land under the manifest id `aiOverviewControl` (lowercase leading `a`); the two
manual methods below use the `AiOverviewControl` display-name casing instead —
see [docs/installation.md](./docs/installation.md) for why that matters on
case-sensitive filesystems.

### Release Archive

Download the `.tar.gz` or `.zip` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/bernardopg/AiOverviewControl/releases/latest),
extract it as `AiOverviewControl`, and place it in the DMS plugin directory:

```text
~/.config/DankMaterialShell/plugins/AiOverviewControl
```

Then restore executable bits and restart DMS:

```bash
chmod +x ~/.config/DankMaterialShell/plugins/AiOverviewControl/providers/get-*
dms restart
```

### Git Checkout

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bernardopg/AiOverviewControl.git \
  ~/.config/DankMaterialShell/plugins/AiOverviewControl
chmod +x ~/.config/DankMaterialShell/plugins/AiOverviewControl/providers/get-*
dms restart
```

Enable **AiOverviewControl** in DMS settings and add it to a DankBar section.
Detailed installation and upgrade guidance is available in
[docs/installation.md](./docs/installation.md).

## Configuration

Settings are stored by DMS and survive plugin upgrades.

| Setting | Values | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Language | `auto`, `en_US`, `pt_BR`, `zh_CN`, `es_ES`, `de_DE` | `auto` |
| Tracked providers | comma-separated provider IDs | `codex,claude,copilot` |
| Dashboard density | `comfortable`, `compact` | `comfortable` |
| Pill mode | `auto`, `custom`, `top` | `auto` |
| Custom pill providers | comma-separated tracked-provider IDs | tracked providers |
| DankBar usage window | `provider:slot` pairs, slot `primary`, `secondary`, `tertiary`, or `highest` (e.g. `claude:secondary`) | primary window |
| DankBar pill tooltip | enabled or disabled | enabled |
| Pinned providers | comma-separated provider IDs | empty |
| Provider logo color | any QML color string | current DMS primary color |
| Refresh interval | 1, 2, 5, 15, or 30 minutes | 2 minutes |
| Show provider errors | enabled or disabled | enabled |
| Claude project breakdown | enabled or disabled | enabled |
| Individual Antigravity models | enabled or disabled | disabled |
| Quota notifications | enabled or disabled | enabled |
| Global notification threshold | 75%, 85%, or 95% | 85% |
| Per-provider thresholds | comma-separated `provider:percent` pairs (e.g. `claude:90,codex:75`), validated inline | empty |
| Windows that raise alerts | `displayed` (follows the DankBar window), `all`, or `primary` | `displayed` |
| Re-alert interval | once per window, 1h, 6h, or 24h (updates the existing alert) | once per window |
| History retention | 500, 2,000, or 10,000 snapshots | 2,000 |

Settings also offers **Export usage history** (CSV or JSONL) and a two-step
**Reset plugin settings**, which restores every option above without touching
the recorded history.

The default provider selection is:

```text
codex,claude,copilot
```

API-backed providers read credentials from the DMS process environment. An
export available only in an interactive shell may not reach a graphical DMS
session. See [Configuration](./docs/configuration.md) for the environment
variable matrix and health-check behavior.

## Dashboard Behavior

- The hero shows a **fleet overview** when two or more providers resolve: the
  average load across measurable quota windows, the hottest provider, how many
  sit at or above 80%, and the soonest reset across the fleet. Balance,
  analytics, local-runtime, and informational cards are intentionally excluded
  from the average denominator so their truthful `0%` placeholders do not dilute
  real quota pressure. Peak, at-risk count, and reset still scan all live cards.
- The overview is **navigable**: click the fleet rollup's peak provider, or the
  hero usage bars, to expand and scroll straight to that provider's card.
- Cards are sorted with pinned providers first, then by highest measurable
  usage, with failed providers last.
- Cards support keyboard focus plus Enter/Space (expand), Delete (remove),
  P (pin), and R (retry) actions.
- Data becomes stale after twice the configured refresh interval.
- Failed cards expose a provider-specific retry action.
- Expanded cards show available windows, credits, source, identity, and update
  time without inventing unavailable fields.
- Usage snapshots are stored locally in
  `~/.cache/AiOverviewControl/usage-history.jsonl` and trimmed according to the
  configured retention. The history writer records only real non-zero quota/spend
  pressure; informational, local-runtime, balance-only, and analytics-only `0%`
  placeholders are skipped so sparklines remain meaningful. Because the store is
  trimmed, `providers/export-usage-history csv|jsonl` (also a button in
  Settings) is the way to keep long-term data.
- Claude analytics run separately so local history or OAuth failures cannot
  block the main provider collection.

## Privacy and Resilience

- Credentials are read from provider CLIs, local provider-owned data, or
  environment variables; the UI never displays secret values.
- The plugin does not scrape authenticated web dashboards.
- It does not call paid inference endpoints merely to test a key.
- Temporary files are isolated per run and removed when collection finishes.
- Provider errors are returned as structured data instead of terminating the
  complete refresh.
- Informational cards use explicit text and official links rather than
  synthetic percentages.

## Validation

<details>
<summary>Run the same core checks used by CI</summary>
<br>

QML lint is a **hard gate** in CI (Qt5 `qmllint`, syntax verification — no
`qs.*` import-resolution noise to filter). A malformed QML file fails the build.

```bash
jq -e . plugin.json >/dev/null
for file in i18n/*.json; do jq -e . "$file" >/dev/null; done
find providers -maxdepth 1 -type f -print0 | xargs -0 bash -n
for test in tests/*.sh; do bash -n "$test"; done
bash -n scripts/package-release
for test in tests/*.sh; do bash "$test"; done
shellcheck -S warning providers/* tests/*.sh scripts/package-release scripts/render-contributors
qmllint \
  AiOverviewControlWidget.qml \
  AiOverviewControlSettings.qml \
  AiOverviewControlI18n.qml \
  ProviderLogo.qml
./providers/get-provider-health "codex,claude,copilot,pi" | jq .
./providers/get-provider-usage \
  "codex,claude,copilot,pi" \
  ./providers/get-copilot-usage | jq .
./providers/get-usage-history | jq .
./providers/export-usage-history csv /tmp
```

GitHub Actions additionally validates workflow syntax, locale key parity,
provider script permissions, integration contracts, Crowdin configuration,
and release packaging.
