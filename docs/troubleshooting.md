# Troubleshooting

The `PLUGIN=` path below matches a manual checkout or release-archive install
(see [installation](./installation.md)), which uses the `AiOverviewControl`
display-name casing. A DMS plugin-store install instead uses the manifest id
and lands at `~/.config/DankMaterialShell/plugins/aiOverviewControl`
(lowercase leading `a`) — Linux paths are case-sensitive, so adjust the
`PLUGIN=` line below to match whichever directory `ls
~/.config/DankMaterialShell/plugins` actually shows. The commands shown in the
plugin's own Settings panel always use the correct path for your install
automatically.

## No cards appear

```bash
PLUGIN=~/.config/DankMaterialShell/plugins/AiOverviewControl
$PLUGIN/providers/get-provider-health "codex,claude,copilot" | jq .
$PLUGIN/providers/get-provider-usage "codex,claude,copilot" $PLUGIN/providers/get-copilot-usage | jq .
```

If terminal output is valid, run `qmllint` and restart DMS.

## Codex

```bash
codex --version
codex login
$PLUGIN/providers/get-codex-usage | jq .
```

The adapter requires a Codex CLI version with `app-server` and `account/rateLimits/read`. It retries a transient rate-limit transport failure once and may reuse a successful snapshot for up to 15 minutes; the original `updatedAt` timestamp is preserved so the card can become visibly stale. Authentication failures never use this cache. Persistent app-server failures surface the underlying JSON-RPC message when one is available.

The app-server may temporarily return only a `10080`-minute weekly window in `rateLimits.primary` with `secondary: null`. The plugin labels that window **Weekly** from its duration. OpenAI's current pricing documentation still describes a shared five-hour window plus possible weekly limits, so a missing five-hour row should be treated as a server/account response change or incident, not automatically as a formally announced quota-policy change.

## Claude

If the local analytics are present but the 5-hour window shows an authentication error, renew the Claude subscription session:

```bash
claude auth login --claudeai
```

The plugin only reuses a successful quota response for two minutes. Expired credentials and older cache files are reported as errors instead of being displayed as `0%` usage.

```bash
claude auth status
./providers/get-claude-usage
```

Claude analytics require readable JSONL files under `~/.claude/projects` (or `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/projects` when `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is set). Quota windows are best-effort and may be absent when Claude Code changes its private OAuth behavior.

## Copilot

```bash
gh auth status
gh api user --jq .login
./providers/get-copilot-usage | jq .
```

The adapter uses the GitHub-authenticated Copilot quota snapshot. If the regional `api.github.com` route fails before returning HTTP, it retries through another GitHub edge with normal TLS hostname verification. The last valid response may be reused for up to one hour and is labeled `github-copilot-cache`.

## Environment variable is present in a terminal but missing in settings

DMS may have been started before the variable was exported. A shell-only export — including one in `~/.zshenv` — is not inherited by an existing systemd-managed graphical session. Import it from a terminal where it is already set, restart DMS, and run the health helper again:

```bash
systemctl --user import-environment COMMAND_CODE_API_KEY
systemctl --user restart dms.service
```

For Command Code specifically, `cmd login` is usually preferable: the plugin reads the CLI's protected `~/.commandcode/auth.json` credential when `COMMAND_CODE_API_KEY` is absent from DMS. The helper reports credential source names only, never secret values.

## xAI / Grok shows "XAI_API_KEY is not set"

You do not need an inference API key to see SuperGrok / Grok Build usage. Sign in with `grok login` so `~/.grok/auth.json` exists; the card reads that file (or `$GROK_HOME/auth.json`) the same way the CLI does. Graphical DMS sessions do not inherit shell exports, so `export XAI_API_KEY=…` in a terminal will not reach the widget until you import it into the user systemd environment — `grok login` avoids that.

An `XAI_API_KEY` from [console.x.ai](https://console.x.ai/team/default/api-keys) only proves the key works. It cannot return remaining credits. Prepaid API balance needs a **Management** key (Settings → Management Keys), not an inference key:

```bash
export XAI_MANAGEMENT_KEY="xai-mgmt-..."
export XAI_TEAM_ID="your-team-uuid"
```

The Management ledger settles behind the console, so a balance read mid-cycle can lag what console.x.ai shows.

The team ID is in the console URL and in the Grok CLI login (`team_id` in `auth.json`). Grok OIDC access tokens currently expire after about six hours. If `auth.json` has a refresh token, the card runs the installed `grok models` command to renew the session silently, then retries billing once. It checks `PATH`, `$GROK_HOME/bin/grok`, `~/.grok/bin/grok`, and `~/.local/bin/grok`. If automatic renewal fails, run `grok login` again. A failed renewal is not retried on every poll: the card waits `XAI_REFRESH_COOLDOWN` seconds (default `300`) before launching the CLI again, so a broken session does not spawn a Grok process every refresh.

A temporary billing timeout or server failure does not trigger token renewal. The card reports that failure separately so an xAI outage is not mistaken for a bad login.

## Provider shows zero percent

Zero can mean one of three things:

- the provider reports a real unused quota;
- the provider exposes balance/status but no total from which a percentage can be calculated;
- the card is informational because no public quota API exists.

Read the card's source and display value rather than assuming every provider has a percentage quota.

## Antigravity quota or account layout

The normal Antigravity view deliberately groups known quotas as **Gemini Models** and **Claude & OpenAI Models**. These are family quotas, not placeholders: each reflects the model in that family with the least quota remaining. A real unrecognized model is isolated under **Other Models**, while internal placeholder entries are discarded. With multiple locally signed-in accounts, expand the card to see the family rows under each account email and install.

If the result looks inconsistent with the Antigravity Models screen, refresh the plugin and check the raw response without exposing credentials:

```bash
PLUGIN=~/.config/DankMaterialShell/plugins/AiOverviewControl
$PLUGIN/providers/get-provider-usage antigravity | jq .
```

For a temporary model-by-model diagnosis, enable **Show individual Antigravity models** in the plugin settings, then expand the Antigravity card. Turn it off again to return to the concise view. A **Partial** badge means at least one account succeeded and another failed; the expanded warning identifies the account, request stage, and cause. If every account fails, the card reports the actual OAuth, HTTP, rate-limit, or schema error. If the helper reports no session at all, open the affected Antigravity installation, sign in, and ensure `sqlite3` is installed.

## Hermes telemetry

Hermes reads `$HERMES_HOME/state.db` (default `~/.hermes/state.db`) read-only, so the gateway can keep running while the card refreshes.

- **Card reports "state database not found"** — Hermes has not created its state database yet, or it lives elsewhere. Start Hermes once (`hermes`), or export `HERMES_HOME` for a custom install (native Windows installs live under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes`).
- **Card reports "sqlite3 is required"** — install the `sqlite3` command-line binary; the adapter uses it instead of linking a SQLite library.
- **Cost shows `$0` while tokens grow** — expected. Hermes resolves pricing upstream, so `estimated_cost_usd` / `actual_cost_usd` are frequently `0` for routed providers. Tokens and API calls carry the real signal, which is why the 7-day chart plots tokens.
- **"Top projects" is empty** — only sessions that recorded a working directory appear there. Gateway sessions (Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord) have no `cwd`, so a week of chat-only usage legitimately shows no projects; the session-source badges still break the traffic down.
- **Numbers look stale right after a conversation** — the expanded telemetry is cached for 120s (matching the default refresh interval). Press **Refresh** twice, or wait one cycle.

## Slow refresh or timeout

The widget has a 45-second total timeout. Each network adapter also has a shorter curl timeout. Reduce the selected provider count, increase the refresh interval, and test providers individually.

## Notifications do not appear

Quota alerts require `notify-send` and `flock` in the environment that starts
DMS:

```bash
command -v notify-send flock
```

The helper stores deduplication state under
`${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/AiOverviewControl/notify-state.json`. Test a
notification without exposing provider credentials:

```bash
PLUGIN=~/.config/DankMaterialShell/plugins/AiOverviewControl
bash "$PLUGIN/providers/send-quota-alert" \
  manual-test 0 normal dialog-warning '#6750A4' \
  'AiOverviewControl test' 'Notification helper is working.'
```

Adjust `PLUGIN` for a plugin-store install as described at the top of this page.

## A quota window never alerts

By default only the window the DankBar shows for that provider raises alerts
(`notifyWindowScope` = `displayed`, which equals the primary window until a
`barWindowOverrides` slot is set). To be alerted on Claude's 5 hour *and*
7 day windows, or Codex's weekly alongside its session window, set **Windows
that raise alerts** to `all` in Settings.

If a per-provider threshold seems ignored, check the inline validation under
**Per-provider threshold overrides** — entries with an unknown provider ID, a
provider that is not tracked, or a percentage outside 1–100 are discarded at
runtime and are now reported there as you type.

## Exporting the usage history

The local store is trimmed to the configured retention, so keep a copy before
it rotates:

```bash
PLUGIN=~/.config/DankMaterialShell/plugins/AiOverviewControl
"$PLUGIN/providers/export-usage-history" csv     # spreadsheet-friendly
"$PLUGIN/providers/export-usage-history" jsonl   # raw store
```

The script prints the file it wrote. Exit code `3` means no snapshot has been
recorded yet (or none is readable), and `4` means the destination directory
could not be written. Settings exposes the same two formats as buttons.

## QML validation

```bash
qmllint AiOverviewControlWidget.qml AiOverviewControlSettings.qml AiOverviewControlI18n.qml ProviderLogo.qml
for file in i18n/*.json; do jq . "$file"; done
```
