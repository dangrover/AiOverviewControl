# Configuration

All settings are stored through DMS. Plugin updates do not overwrite user choices.

## Settings

| Key | Values | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `languageOverride` | `auto`, `en_US`, `pt_BR`, `zh_CN`, `es_ES`, `de_DE` | `auto` | UI language. `auto` follows the system locale. |
| `providerSelection` | comma-separated IDs | `codex,claude,copilot` | Enabled providers; at least one is retained. |
| `refreshInterval` | 60000, 120000, 300000, 900000, 1800000 | 120000 | Refresh interval in milliseconds. |
| `showErrorProviders` | `true` / `false` | `true` | Keep failed provider cards visible. |
| `densityMode` | `comfortable`, `compact` | `comfortable` | Compact cards hide the preview bar; expanded details remain available. |
| `pillMode` | `auto`, `custom`, `top` | `auto` | DankBar pill providers: measurable providers, an explicit compact subset, or the most-used provider. |
| `pillProviders` | comma-separated IDs | provider selection | Strict provider subset used by `custom` pill mode. The settings UI exposes this as provider chips and never falls back to every tracked provider. |
| `barWindowOverrides` | `provider:slot,...` | empty | Per-provider DankBar usage window, for example `claude:secondary`. Slot is `primary` (default), `secondary`, `tertiary`, or `highest` (most-constrained). Dashboard cards and history keep the primary window. Notifications follow this choice by default (`notifyWindowScope` = `displayed`). Providers whose payload lacks the chosen slot fall back to the primary window. |
| `pillTooltip` | `true` / `false` | `true` | Hovering the DankBar pill shows the provider, the quota window the percentage came from, and the reset. With one provider in the pill it also appends `resets in ...`. |
| `pinnedProviders` | comma-separated IDs | empty | Pinned cards sort before other cards. |
| `providerLogoColor` | QML color string | current DMS primary color | Monochrome tint used for provider logos and notification icons. |
| `quotaNotifications` | `true` / `false` | `true` | Enables quota threshold notifications. |
| `notifyThreshold` | 75, 85, or 95 | 85 | Global notification threshold. Per-provider `notifyThresholds` overrides accept any value from 1–100. |
| `notifyThresholds` | `provider:percent,...` | empty | Per-provider threshold overrides, for example `codex:75,claude:90`. Settings validates the CSV inline: malformed pairs, unknown or duplicated providers, providers that are not tracked, and percentages outside 1–100 are reported as you type. |
| `notifyWindowScope` | `displayed`, `all`, `primary` | `displayed` | Which quota windows raise alerts. `displayed` follows `barWindowOverrides` — identical to `primary` until an override is set. `all` also alerts on Claude's 7 day, Codex's weekly, and every other secondary window. `primary` restores the pre-1.12 primary-only behaviour. Each window keeps its own dedupe key, so one provider can alert on both of its windows without either replacing the other. |
| `notifyCooldownMinutes` | 0, 60, 360, or 1440 | 0 | Minutes between repeat alerts; `0` means once per quota window. |
| `historyRetention` | 500, 2000, or 10000 | 2000 | Maximum history snapshots kept locally. |
| `showClaudeProjects` | `true` / `false` | `true` | Shows Claude local project analytics. |
| `showAntigravityModelDetails` | `true` / `false` | `false` | In expanded Antigravity cards, replaces concise Gemini / Claude & OpenAI family rows with individual model rows. |

## Exporting usage history

The local store (`${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-~/.cache}/AiOverviewControl/usage-history.jsonl`)
is trimmed to `historyRetention` snapshots, so long-term data needs a copy.
Settings offers **Export usage history** with two formats, and the same script
is runnable directly:

```bash
./providers/export-usage-history csv     # spreadsheet-friendly
./providers/export-usage-history jsonl   # raw store
./providers/export-usage-history csv ~/some/directory
```

It prints the absolute path of the file it wrote on stdout and writes it
`0600`. The destination defaults to the XDG download directory, then
`~/Downloads`, then `$HOME`.

## Resetting

**Reset plugin settings** in Settings restores every key in this table to its
default, including tracked providers, pins, notification thresholds, and
DankBar overrides. It is a two-step confirmation and never touches the
recorded usage history.

## Antigravity display

The default presentation mirrors Antigravity's Models screen: **Gemini Models** and **Claude & OpenAI Models**. Each family shows the most constrained model's usage and reset, which is the safe value to act on when models share a quota pool. A real model that cannot yet be classified appears under **Other Models**; internal placeholder entries are never displayed.

One detected account stays in the normal provider-card layout. When two or more local Antigravity sessions are found, the expanded card shows one clearly labelled block per account and install. If one session fails while another succeeds, the card remains live and shows a partial-account warning with the failed stage and reason. Enable **Show individual Antigravity models** only when diagnosing a model-specific difference; it intentionally adds more rows.

## Environment variables

Environment variables must be present in the process that starts DMS. Shell-only exports (including `~/.zshenv`) may not reach a graphical session. For a systemd-managed DMS session, either run `cmd login` for Command Code (the plugin safely reads its CLI-owned `~/.commandcode/auth.json` fallback), or import an already-exported key and restart DMS:

```bash
systemctl --user import-environment COMMAND_CODE_API_KEY
systemctl --user restart dms.service
```

For a durable environment-variable setup, configure your display manager or user-service environment rather than relying on an interactive shell.

## Provider readiness labels

The settings health check describes whether the plugin can run an adapter in the current DMS process; it is not a claim that the provider publishes a quota API.

- **Ready** means the required CLI, local session, database, or environment variable was found.
- **Missing** names the credential or executable that DMS cannot see. In particular, a key exported only by an interactive shell is invisible when DMS was started by the graphical session.
- **Informational** means the provider does not expose a stable public read-only quota surface. The plugin can still show a card that points to the official usage page.
- **Checking…** is transient while the asynchronous readiness command runs. Provider changes made during a running check are queued and checked immediately afterward.

| Provider | Variables |
| --- | --- |
| Copilot | `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN`, or `GITHUB_TOKEN` |
| Gemini | `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, or `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` |
| OpenRouter | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` |
| DeepSeek | `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` |
| Kimi | Balance: `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` or `KIMI_API_KEY` (optional `MOONSHOT_API_BASE`). Kimi Code subscription quota: `KIMI_CODING_API_KEY` (or a `sk-kimi-` prefixed `KIMI_API_KEY`; optional `KIMI_BASE_URL`) |
| MiniMax | `MINIMAX_TOKEN_PLAN_KEY` (Token Plan Subscription Key, `sk-cp-...`) — backward-compatible: a `sk-cp-` value in `MINIMAX_API_KEY` is also recognised. PAYG `sk-api-` keys stay on `MINIMAX_API_KEY` and surface auth-only; set both to keep an auth-only card when the Token Plan endpoint is unreachable. Optional `MINIMAX_API_BASE` retargets both read-only endpoints at a gateway or mirror. |
| Command Code | `COMMAND_CODE_API_KEY`, or the `apiKey` saved by `cmd login` in `~/.commandcode/auth.json` |
| GLM / Z.ai | `ZAI_API_KEY`, `GLM_API_KEY`, or `ZHIPU_API_KEY`; optional `GLM_API_BASE` |
| Mistral | `MISTRAL_API_KEY` |
| Ollama | optional `OLLAMA_HOST`; requires the `ollama` CLI in PATH |
| Hermes | optional `HERMES_HOME` (defaults to `~/.hermes`) |
| Claude Code | optional `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` (defaults to `~/.claude`) |
| NVIDIA | `NVIDIA_API_KEY` |
| Cloudflare | `CLOUDFLARE_AI_TOKEN` or `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`; optional `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` |
| Vertex AI | requires `gcloud auth print-access-token` to succeed at collection time; the readiness chip checks only that the `gcloud` CLI is in `PATH`. Optional `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`, `GCLOUD_PROJECT`, or `VERTEXAI_PROJECT` enrich the reported identity |
| BytePlus | `BYTEPLUS_API_KEY` or `ARK_API_KEY` |
| Qwen | `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` or `QWEN_API_KEY`; optional `DASHSCOPE_WORKSPACE_ID` |
| Together | `TOGETHER_API_KEY` |
| Groq | `GROQ_API_KEY` |
| Cohere | `COHERE_API_KEY` |
| Replicate | `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` |
| Fireworks | `FIREWORKS_API_KEY`; optional `FIREWORKS_ACCOUNT_ID` enables quota data |
| AI21 | `AI21_API_KEY` |
| xAI | `grok login` (`~/.grok/auth.json` or `$GROK_HOME`) for SuperGrok usage. Keep the Grok CLI installed so the adapter can renew its short-lived OIDC access token. Optional `XAI_API_KEY` (inference auth-only). Prepaid API credits: `XAI_MANAGEMENT_KEY` or `XAI_MANAGEMENT_API_KEY`, plus `XAI_TEAM_ID`. Optional `GROK_CLI_CHAT_PROXY_BASE_URL` overrides the CLI billing host, and `XAI_REFRESH_COOLDOWN` (seconds, default `300`) how soon a failed token renewal may be retried. |
| Kilo | `KILO_API_KEY` |

## Health indicators

The settings page executes `providers/get-provider-health` for selected providers:

- Green: required CLI, local database, or environment variable is present.
- Amber: a prerequisite is missing.
- Neutral: informational provider or no check is applicable.

Health checks do not send network requests and never print secret values.

Quota notifications require `notify-send` and `flock` in the DMS process environment. Antigravity readiness requires either `secret-tool` for keyring-backed sessions or `sqlite3` plus a readable IDE state database.
