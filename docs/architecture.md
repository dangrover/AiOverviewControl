```

Most API-backed and informational providers expose a normalized JSON
`get-<id>-usage` entrypoint that delegates through `get-provider-wrapper`. The
specialized Claude helper emits `KEY=VALUE` analytics for the dispatcher to
normalize, and `pi` and `hermes` use inline dispatcher envelopes plus
`get-pi-analytics` / `get-hermes-analytics`. Note that the "stub" shape
describes only the entrypoint file: several adapters implement their real logic
as native envelopes inside `get-provider-usage` (for example `commandcode`,
`ollama`, and Antigravity), while the thin `get-<id>-usage` files remain the
stable contract surface.

## Runtime flow

1. The widget resolves its own plugin directory through `PluginService` or its QML URL.
2. It verifies that the dispatcher and core commands are available.
3. It executes `get-provider-usage <provider-csv> <copilot-helper>`.
4. The dispatcher calls one adapter per provider and validates every result with `jq`.
5. QML normalizes the JSON array, isolates errors, updates stale timestamps, and renders cards.
6. Claude details run in a separate process so analytics failure cannot block other providers.
7. `pi` follows the same isolation principle via a lighter mechanism: its dispatcher-side envelope (`fetch_pi_native`, inline in `get-provider-usage`) only ever reads a cached snapshot and never scans session files itself; the expanded card's own process (`get-pi-analytics`) does the actual scan on the normal refresh cycle.
8. `hermes` splits the same way, but its collapsed-card envelope (`fetch_hermes_native`) queries `~/.hermes/state.db` directly instead of a cache: the aggregates are indexed SQLite sums that complete in milliseconds, so first paint carries real numbers without waiting for the analytics process.

## Provider contract

Successful adapters return:

```text
provider
source
usage.identity.providerID
usage.identity.accountEmail
usage.identity.loginMethod
usage.primary / secondary / tertiary
  usedPercent
  windowMinutes
  resetsAt
  resetDescription
  displayValue (optional)
usage.updatedAt
accounts[] (optional; local multi-account providers)
  windows (concise quota families)
  modelWindows (optional advanced detail)
credits.remaining
```

Errors return:

```json
{
  "provider": "example",
  "source": "example-api",
  "error": {
    "code": 2,
    "kind": "provider",
    "message": "EXAMPLE_API_KEY is not set."
  }
}
```

## Codex protocol

`get-codex-usage` starts `codex app-server`, completes the `initialize` / `initialized` handshake, sends `account/read` and `account/rateLimits/read`, then maps the official response to the common schema. The bridge reads until both account and rate-limit responses arrive instead of closing stdin after a fixed delay. It retries an authenticated account's transient rate-limit failure once, then may reuse a successful snapshot for up to 15 minutes while preserving its original `updatedAt` timestamp. Authentication failures never fall back to cached data. The bridge uses a bounded process lifetime and never reads browser state.

Window labels are derived from `windowDurationMins`, not from whether app-server placed a limit in `primary` or `secondary`. This matters for current weekly-only responses, where `primary.windowDurationMins` is `10080` and `secondary` is null. OpenAI's current pricing page still documents a shared five-hour window with additional weekly limits, so a weekly-only app-server payload is handled as a temporary or account-specific response shape rather than interpreted as a confirmed policy removal.

## Antigravity protocol

`get-antigravity-usage` reads local Antigravity OAuth sessions from the `agy` CLI token file (`~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/antigravity-oauth-token`), desktop keyring, and each IDE SQLite state database. It refreshes each session and calls `v1internal:loadCodeAssist` followed by `v1internal:retrieveUserQuotaSummary` on `daily-cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com`. Supplying the account's Cloud Code Assist project is essential: an empty request may receive a generic entitlement view and incorrectly report 0% use. The adapter aborts that account before the quota call when the project is absent. Refresh tokens are form-encoded from stdin; bearer tokens use an ephemeral curl config descriptor. Neither secret is printed or placed in process arguments.

Quota-summary groups publish separate 5-hour and weekly `windows` for **Gemini Models** and **Claude & OpenAI Models**. Unknown window kinds and buckets without a numeric remaining fraction are omitted rather than invented; if no readable window remains, that account reports a schema error. The compact card chooses the most constrained window, while the expanded single-account and multi-account views render every reported window. If quota-summary is unavailable on a deployment, the adapter retries the previous `fetchAvailableModels` method and preserves its per-model values in `modelWindows`; that fallback groups models by family and exposes the optional `showAntigravityModelDetails` troubleshooting view.

Every account request captures HTTP status and validates the response schema. Partial failures are retained in `accountErrors` while healthy accounts remain usable; an all-account failure becomes a provider error carrying the first precise cause instead of the generic “no session” message.

## pi protocol

`pi` is Analytics-only (no quota API) — same tier as Claude's local half, Cloudflare, and 9Router. It splits the same way 9Router does: `fetch_pi_native()` (inline in `get-provider-usage`) builds the cheap collapsed-card envelope, and the standalone `providers/get-pi-analytics` does the real work for the expanded "pi telemetry" card.

`get-pi-analytics` scans `~/.pi/agent/sessions/**/*.jsonl` (recursively, `find -L` — the sessions directory may be a symlink to a synced folder, and plain `find` silently returns nothing in that case). Each session file is aggregated once (cwd from its `{type:"session"}` header, tokens/cost from `{type:"message"}` lines with a `usage` payload) and the whole file's totals are bucketed to its local start day — sessions are not split across midnight, matching the existing `~/.pi/agent/extensions/session-breakdown.ts` TUI tool's convention. Provider/model come directly off each message; a `{type:"model_change"}` fallback exists for older/partial formats. Results are cached at `${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/AiOverviewControl/pi-analytics-cache.json` with a 120s TTL (matches the default `refreshInterval`), so the full scan only runs once per window regardless of poll frequency; the envelope function only ever reads that cache, never triggering a scan itself.

## Hermes protocol

`hermes` ([NousResearch/hermes-agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent)) is the only **dual-nature** entry: an agent harness that is simultaneously a provider front (it routes its own spend through Nous Portal, OpenRouter, and friends). The dashboard therefore tags it `Agent · Provider`, and the two natures come from different files under `$HERMES_HOME` (default `~/.hermes`):

| Nature | Source | Rendered as |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Agent harness | `state.db` — `sessions` joined to `session_model_usage` | Today/Week/Month tokens + cost, 7-day chart, top models, top projects, session sources, session/message/API-call counters |
| Provider front | `config.yaml` (`model.default`, `model.provider`) and `auth.json` (`active_provider`) | Card identity line (`<billing provider> · <default model>`), login method, "Open console" → [Nous Portal](https://portal.nousresearch.com) |

Coverage is Analytics-only: Hermes exposes no local quota API, and cost columns are frequently `0` because pricing resolution happens upstream — tokens and API calls carry the real signal, so the expanded chart plots tokens rather than cost.

All SQLite access is `-readonly`: the gateway keeps `state.db` live in WAL mode, and the adapter must never take a write lock on a database the agent is actively using. Usage rows bucket to each session's **local start day** (`date(started_at,'unixepoch','localtime')`), matching the pi adapter's convention — sessions spanning midnight are not split.

`providers/get-hermes-analytics` caches its snapshot at `${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/AiOverviewControl/hermes-analytics-cache.json` with a 120s TTL (matches the default `refreshInterval`). Counters are queried independently rather than as one combined `SELECT`, so an older Hermes schema missing a table degrades that single counter instead of zeroing all of them. A missing `state.db` returns a provider error, and a missing `sqlite3` binary returns a runtime error — never a crash or an empty card.

## Settings keys

| Key | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `providerSelection` | `codex,claude,copilot` | Comma-separated provider IDs. |
| `refreshInterval` | `120000` | Poll interval in milliseconds. |
| `showErrorProviders` | `true` | Keep provider failures visible. |
| `pillMode` | `auto` | Automatic, custom, or highest-usage (`top`) DankBar provider list. |
| `pillProviders` | selection | Strict custom DankBar provider subset; independent from the tracked provider list. |
| `barWindowOverrides` | empty | Per-provider DankBar usage window (`provider:slot`, e.g. `claude:secondary`); slot is `primary`/`secondary`/`tertiary`/`highest`, with graceful fallback to the primary window when the slot is absent from the payload. Cards, hero, and history keep the primary window; notifications follow it by default through `notifyWindowScope`. |
| `densityMode` | `comfortable` | Comfortable or compact card layout. |
| `languageOverride` | `auto` | Plugin locale override. |
| `quotaNotifications` | `true` | Enable desktop quota notifications. |
| `notifyThreshold` | `85` | Global quota notification threshold. |
| `notifyThresholds` | empty | Per-provider `id:percent` notification overrides. |
| `notifyWindowScope` | `displayed` | Quota windows evaluated by `checkNotifications()`: `displayed` (the window the DankBar shows, per `barWindowOverrides`), `all` (every window in the payload), or `primary`. |
| `notifyCooldownMinutes` | `0` | Minimum minutes between in-place notification updates; `0` means once per quota window. |
| `historyRetention` | `2000` | Maximum local usage-history snapshots. |
| `pinnedProviders` | empty | Provider IDs sorted before unpinned cards. |
| `providerLogoColor` | current DMS primary color | Monochrome tint for provider logos and notification icons. |
| `pillTooltip` | `true` | Show the hover tooltip describing the DankBar pill's provider, window, percentage, and reset. |
| `showClaudeProjects` | `true` | Show Claude local project analytics. |
| `showAntigravityModelDetails` | `false` | Replace Antigravity family rows with per-model rows in expanded cards. |

Legacy settings unknown to the current code are ignored.

## Resilience

- Overall collection timeout: 45 seconds.
- Provider failures are data, not dispatcher failures.
- Temporary files live in one per-run directory and are removed on exit.
- Informational, local-runtime, balance-only, and analytics-only providers may return a valid `usage` object with a truthful `0%` placeholder; those placeholders are rendered but not written to history.
- `usage-history.jsonl` records only non-zero quota/spend pressure, so sparklines and trends are not polluted by flat informational cards.
- Fixture-backed test suites export a sandboxed `XDG_CACHE_HOME` before invoking the real dispatcher, so they never append snapshots to a real history store.
- The dashboard marks data stale after two refresh intervals.
- Process command arrays are snapshotted before execution to avoid reactive mutation.

## UI structure

- DankBar pill: selected measurable providers. Per provider, `barWindowOverrides` selects which usage window the pill displays (`primary` by default, or `secondary`/`tertiary`/`highest`); the ranking used by `top` and `auto` pill modes follows the same displayed number.
- Overview: active/error counts and local backend status.
- Provider manager: add and remove providers without editing settings files.
- Filter: shown when more than five cards are visible. Status chips (All / Live / Issues, with counts) appear whenever any provider is configured.
- Cards: collapsed preview, expanded windows, identity, credits, source, and timestamps.
- Claude details: token/cost history and model distribution.
- pi details: token/cost history, 7-day chart, top models, top projects (same expanded-card slot pattern as 9Router).
- Hermes details: identity pills (default model, billing provider, session/message/API-call counters, version), token/cost tiles, 7-day token chart, top models, top projects, and session-source badges.
